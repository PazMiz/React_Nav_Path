# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!





See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

----Back Django

Sure! Here are some instructions to set up a Django project:

Install Python: Django is a Python web framework, so you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install Django: Once Python is installed, open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to install Django:

Copy code
pip install django
This command will install the latest version of Django.

Create a new Django project: In the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project. Then run the following command to create a new Django project:

Copy code
django-admin startproject projectname
Replace projectname with the desired name for your project.

Navigate to the project directory: After the project is created, navigate to the project directory using the following command:

bash
Copy code
cd projectname
Create a Django app: Django projects are composed of one or more apps. To create a new app within your project, run the following command:

Copy code
python manage.py startapp appname
Replace appname with the desired name for your app.

Configure the database: Django comes with a built-in database abstraction layer. Open the settings.py file within your project directory and find the DATABASES setting. Configure the database settings according to your setup. By default, Django uses SQLite as the database backend.

Run database migrations: Django uses database migrations to create database tables based on your app models. Run the following command to apply migrations:

Copy code
python manage.py migrate
This will create the necessary tables in the database.

Start the development server: You can now start the Django development server using the following command:

Copy code
python manage.py runserver
The development server will start running at http://localhost:8000/.

Create views, URLs, and templates: In your Django app, you need to define views, URLs, and templates to handle requests and render HTML pages. Define your views in the views.py file, map them to URLs in the urls.py file, and create HTML templates in the templates directory.

Access the Django admin: Django provides a built-in admin interface for managing your app's data. To access the admin interface, create a superuser account using the following command:

Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create a username and password. Then you can access the admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin/.

These are the basic steps to get started with Django. You can refer to the Django documentation for more detailed information on various features and concepts: https://docs.djangoproject.com/
